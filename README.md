# Diabetes Risk Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the risk of diabetes based on various medical measurements from the "diabetes.csv" dataset.

## Overview

The project follows a standard data science workflow, with each step implemented in a separate Python script:

1.  **Data Loading:** Loads the `diabetes.csv` dataset.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares the data for analysis.
3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explores the data through summary statistics.
4.  **Data Visualisation:** Creates informative plots to understand data patterns.
5.  **Statistical Analysis:** Performs statistical tests to gain insights.
6.  **Model Training:** Trains a logistic regression model to predict diabetes risk.
7.  **Model Evaluation:** Assesses the performance of the trained model.
